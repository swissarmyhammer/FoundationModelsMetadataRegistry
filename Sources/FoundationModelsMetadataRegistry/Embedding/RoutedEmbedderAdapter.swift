/// `RoutedEmbedder` (a `RoutedModel<any LoadedEmbeddingContainer>`) already
/// exposes `dimension: Int` and `embed(_:) async throws -> [[Float]]` with
/// exactly `TextEmbedding`'s shape and semantics — one `dimension`-length
/// vector per input string, in order, with any embedder-container error
/// rethrown unchanged. No batching or error bridging is needed: this type
/// is a pure pass-through, forwarding both members straight to the wrapped
/// handle.
///
/// One side effect rides along with that pass-through: `RoutedEmbedder`'s
/// own `embed(_:)` best-effort-records one transcript event per call,
/// containing every input text joined together. That recording is the
/// wrapped handle's existing behavior, not something this adapter adds or
/// can opt out of — worth knowing when reasoning about transcript volume
/// during a bulk indexing pass (`MetadataIndex.build`'s batched embed
/// calls).
